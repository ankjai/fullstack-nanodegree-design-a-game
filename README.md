#### How to play 'Hangman'

Hangman is a paper and pencil guessing game for two or more players. One player thinks of a word, phrase or sentence and the other tries to guess it by suggesting letters or numbers, within a certain number of guesses.

This implementation is a one player game. The word is provided by the app and player has to guess char in every step, if user is unable to guess the word in 6 steps player looses.

For more information on game, check wikipedia page [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hangman_%28game%29)

For actual 'Hangman' game app (consuming these APIs), checkout [hangman_game_frontend](https://github.com/ankjai/hangman_game_frontend) project.

#### Scoring

As of now scoring logic of the game is simple, no. of guesses left when player guesses the word is his/her score. For e.g. if player guesses the word when 'guesses left' is 5, the score of that game is 5.

The maximum player can score in a game is 6 and minimum is 1. Player scores 0 for lost or aborted games.

#### Ranking

Ranking of players on the other hand is very complex and it uses python module [TrueSkill](http://trueskill.org/) for ranking of players.

TrueSkill is a rating system among game players. It was developed by Microsoft Research and has been used on Xbox LIVE for ranking and matchmaking service. This system quantifies playersâ€™ TRUE skill points by the Bayesian inference algorithm. It also works well with any type of match rule including N:N team game or free-for-all.
