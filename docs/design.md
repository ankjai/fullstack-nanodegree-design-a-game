###### Endpoints

For the 'Hangman Game', I have exposed 3 APIs:

| API | Path | Version | Endpoints |
|---|---|---|---|
| User | /user | /v1 | /create_user, /get_user, /update_user, /delete_user |
| Score | /score | /v1 | /get_game_score, /get_user_scores, /get_all_scores, /get_user_ranking, /get_leaderboard |
| Game | /game | /v1 | /new_game, /get_game, /guess_char, /get_user_games, /get_user_completed_games, /cancel_game, /get_game_history |

Full API usage [here](docs/api_usage.md)

###### Scoring Impl

Current scoring logic is straight forward, no. of guesses left when player guesses the word is his/her score. But down the path we will have score game depending upon the word length/toughness.

###### Ranking Impl

For ranking players, game is using [TrueSkill](http://trueskill.org/). 

TrueSkill is a rating system among game players. It was developed by Microsoft Research and has been used on Xbox LIVE for ranking and matchmaking service. This system quantifies playersâ€™ TRUE skill points by the Bayesian inference algorithm. It also works well with any type of match rule including N:N team game or free-for-all.

The game is using [Head-to-head (1 vs. 1)](http://trueskill.org/#head-to-head-1-vs-1-match-rule) match rule to rank players.
